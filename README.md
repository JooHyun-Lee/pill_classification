# Pill Classification

## DONE

1. Data Acquiration

2. Data preprocess (except Pill Mask)

3. Deep Neural Network Train Frame-work (with Pytorch)

3. "Shape" Train 
      
      => Model: Baisc ResNet18
      
      => Data Augmentation: Vertical, Horizontal Flip / Tilt / Scaling / Shear
      
      => Acc: 

## TODO

1. Testset / Test.py

2. "Color1", "Color2" Train

3. Multi-Instance, Multi-Label Learning

4. Pill Mask
