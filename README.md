# Pill Classification

## DONE

1. Data Acquiration
<br>

2. Data preprocess (except Pill Mask)
<br>

3. Deep Neural Network Train Frame-work (with Pytorch)

      => Model: Baisc ResNet18
      
      => Data Augmentation: Vertical, Horizontal Flip / Tilt / Scaling / Shear
<br>

4. Shape Train ('Shape' has 11types)

      => Validation Acc: 87% (2 epoch train)
<br>

5. Front Color Train ('Front Color' has 16types)

      => Validation Acc: 
<br>

6. Back Color Train ('Back Color' has 16types)

      => Validation Acc: 
<br>
<br>

## TODO

1. Testset / Test.py

2. Multi-Instance, Multi-Label Learning

3. Pill Mask
