# Pill Classification

## DONE

1. Data Acquiration

2. Data preprocess (except Pill Mask)

3. Deep Neural Network Train Frame-work (with Pytorch)

      => Model: Baisc ResNet18
      
      => Data Augmentation: Vertical, Horizontal Flip / Tilt / Scaling / Shear
     
4. "Shape" Train ('Shape' has 11types)

      => Validation Acc: 87% (2 epoch train)
      
5. "Color1" Train ('Color' has 16types)

      => Validation Acc: 

6. "Color1" Train ('Color' has 16types)

      => Validation Acc: 

## TODO

1. Testset / Test.py

2. Multi-Instance, Multi-Label Learning

3. Pill Mask
